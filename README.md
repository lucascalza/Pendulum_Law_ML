# Pendulum_Law_ML
Short code of machine learning technique to extract value of acceleration of gravity via the pendulum law.
The code uses machine learning techniques to predict the value of acceleration of gravity via the learning done with a convolutional neural network. The values of lengths
and periods are initially generated at random in a chosen interval. From them, the training, validation and test sets are built. An estimate on the root mean square error as well
as on the mean absolute error is given at the end, between the predicted values of the acceleration of gravity and the one obtained via the function of the law, which amounts
to be 9.81 m/s^2
